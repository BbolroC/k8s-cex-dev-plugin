## Version 1.1.0

The new version 1.1.0 of the Kubernetes device plug-in for IBM Crypto Express
(CEX) cards includes the exploration of Prometheus metrics around the crypto
resources managed by the plug-in. It also comes with support for *OCP 4.12* with
enforced *Security Context Constrains (SCC)*. By default the CEX device plugin
now installes into it's own namespace *cex-device-plugin* and all the
deployments have been rearranged for *Kustomize* support to make it easier to
create and update the CEX device plugin entities.

- Prometheus metrics support
- New namespace 'cex-device-plugin' (See
  [Migrating from kube-system to cex-device-plugin Namespace](migration.md))
- Enabled for OCP 4.12 with enforced SCC support

libraries the CEX device plug-in depends on:
