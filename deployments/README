Kustomize-based deployment for the IBM CEX device plugin
========================================================

This folder provides various sub-folders for different deployments
based on kustomize overlays.  To install the IBM CEX device plugin
with an empty config map, just run

$ oc create -k rhocp-create

To create a custom config map during installation, edit the file

configmap/cex_resources.json

It is also possible to use the configuration overlay to only deploy a
configmap via

$ oc create -k configmap

or update an existing config map to a different version with

$ oc apply -k configmap

To update an installation without touching the configmap, simply run

$ oc apply -k rhocp-update

To delete everything related to the IBM CEX device plugin, run

$ oc delete -k rhocp-create

Note that it is not possible to delete everything except the configmap
since it is placed in the cex-device-plugin namespace that will be
deleted by the command above.

To deploy the IBM CEX device plugin on a non RedHat OpenShift
Container Platform cluster, please contact
